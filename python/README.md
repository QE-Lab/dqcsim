Python API
==========

This directory contains the stuff needed for the Python API, in addition to
`setup.py` in the root directory.

`dqcsim`
--------

This folder contains the actual source files for the `dqcsim` module.

Only `dqcsim/common`, `dqcsim/host`, `dqcsim/plugins`, and `dqcsim/__init__.py`
are installed; `dqcsim/tests` contains tests that are only run locally.

`bin`
-----

This folder contains what are practically sh-based symlinks to the user's
Python installation with the filenames that DQCsim searches for when looking
for a plugin based on the `.py` file extension. These are (by default)
installed into the user's `/usr/bin` directory by `pip`.

`tools`
-------

This folder contains some scripts used during the build.

 - `add_swig_directives.py` is used to add directives to the simplified version
   of the C API header generated by `cbindgen` (`target/include/dqcsim-py.h`),
   allowing it to be correctly processed into a CPython module with SWIG.
 - `coverage-helper/python3` contains a fake `python3` executable that chains
   to the real `python3` through `kcov` for coverage generation, even when the
   Python scripts are plugins that were spawned by DQCsim through the links in
   `bin`.
