This folder contains some simple examples for the C++ API. The makefiles should
work if DQCsim is *installed* and discoverable by GCC. That is, the headers are
installed in `/usr/include` and the shared object in `/usr/lib`, as done by
`pip` when DQCsim is installed as root without additional arguments.

Calling `make` in this directory simply compiled and runs all the examples to
make sure they all work.
