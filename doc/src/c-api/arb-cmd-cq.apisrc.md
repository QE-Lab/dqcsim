# ArbData and ArbCmd objects

`ArbData` and `ArbCmd` objects are generic objects that plugin developers may
use to expose custom functionality to the other plugins within the simulation.
DQCsim never does anything with the data contained in either object, but it
does define some basic structure to them.
