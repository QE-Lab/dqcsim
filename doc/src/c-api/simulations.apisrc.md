# Simulations

The easiest way to start a simulation is to use the
[command line interface](../cli/index.md). However, it is also possible to
launch simulations programmatically through DQCsim's host interface. Besides
letting you start simulations without needing to fork a new process, this
interface also allows you to interact with the frontend through a message
queue, send `ArbCmd`s to any plugin, and capture log messages.
