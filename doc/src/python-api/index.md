# Python API

The Python API allows you to use DQCsim using Python 3, in order to both
construct plugins and control simulations. It is built on top of the
[C API](../c-api/index.html), but adds a thick abstraction layer to turn it
into a Pythonic interface.

## How to read this chapter

This chapter serves as a short introduction to DQCsim's Python API to get
you coding quickly. However, it doesn't document every single feature. If
you're looking for an API reference, check out the documentation
[here](https://mbrobbel.github.io/dqcsim/py_/dqcsim/).

The documentation assumes that you already know what DQCsim is, and have a
decent understanding of the basic concepts. If you don't, start
[here](../intro/index.md).
