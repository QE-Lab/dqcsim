# Python API

The Python API allows you to use DQCsim using Python 3, in order to both
construct plugins and control simulations. It is built on top of the
[C API](../c-api/index.html), but adds a thick abstraction layer to turn it
into a Pythonic interface.

## How to read this chapter

This chapter reads like a tutorial to DQCsim's Python API to get you coding
quickly. However, it doesn't even get close to documenting every single
feature. If you're looking for something more complete, check out the
generated API documentation [here](../py_/dqcsim/index.html).

The tutorial assumes that you already know what DQCsim is, and have a decent
understanding of the basic concepts. If you don't, start [here](../index.md).
