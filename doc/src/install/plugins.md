# Plugin distribution

Since DQCsim is only a framework, installing *just* DQCsim doesn't let you do
much besides development. To get started with it quickly, you'll also need to
install some plugins.

This is currently TODO, because there are no supported plugins yet. However,
the current idea is that these will also be distributed through pip, with a
dependency on `dqcsim`. For instance, you should be able to install `dqcsim-qx`
through pip to get the QX simulator with appropriate DQCsim bindings.
