# Rust API

Of course, you can also develop plugins in Rust, since that's DQCsim's native
programming language. Simply add the `dqcsim` crate to your Cargo dependencies,
and use DQCsim's internal structures. You can find the crate documentation
[here](https://mbrobbel.github.io/dqcsim/rust_/dqcsim/).
