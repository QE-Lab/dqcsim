# C++ API

The C++ API, once finished, will allow you to use DQCsim in a way that should
be intuitive for C++11 developers, in order to both construct plugins and
control simulations. However, this API is not anywhere near complete at this
time. To use DQCsim from C++, you'll need to use the
[C API](../c-api/index.html).
